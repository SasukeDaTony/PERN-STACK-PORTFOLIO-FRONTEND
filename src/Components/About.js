            I began a career in technology by obtaining a COMPTIA Network+
            certification. This led me to become an associate at Geek Squad for
            three years. I eventually steered towards the installation Mobile
            Electronics in vehicles instead of applying technological concepts &
            programming languages with computers, which is what I really desired.I
            found the Pursuit Fellowship Organization and began my path to
            becoming a Javascript developer with currently working with the PERN
            Stack for web development. I can be found at <br />
